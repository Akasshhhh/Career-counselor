   \`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/career_chat?schema=public"
   
   # NextAuth

   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
